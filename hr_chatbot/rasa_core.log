Added 'nlp_mitie' to component cache. Key 'nlp_mitie-C:\Users\xingxf03\AI\NLP\chatbot\hr_chatbot\data\total_word_feature_extractor.dat'.
C:\Users\xingxf03\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python36\site-packages\pykwalify\core.py:99: UnsafeLoaderWarning: 
The default 'Loader' for 'load(stream)' without further arguments can be unsafe.
Use 'load(stream, Loader=ruamel.yaml.Loader)' explicitly if that is OK.
Alternatively include the following in your code:

  import warnings
  warnings.simplefilter('ignore', ruamel.yaml.error.UnsafeLoaderWarning)

In most other cases you should consider using 'safe_load(stream)'
  data = yaml.load(stream)
